# Udacity_US-Bikeshare-Data-Exploration
This repository is used for the assignment of Udacity Task 3. Use Interaction Program that explores US bike-share data provided by Motivate bike-sharing system
# Overview
In this project, I will use the Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States — Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
* I will write the code to import the data and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
* I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
* The source code takes in raw input from the user to create an interactive experience.
# Python File:
* bikeshare.py

# Project Details:
# The Datasets:
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)<br>
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year
# Statistics Analysis:
Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:
* 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)<br>  

	* most common month
	* most common day of week
	* most common hour of day
* 2 Popular stations and trip

	* most common start station
	* most common end station
	* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)<br>  
* 3 Trip duration

	* total travel time
	* average travel time<br>  
* 4 User info

	* counts of each user type
	* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
	* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)<br>
